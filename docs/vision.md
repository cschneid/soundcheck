# Spotify Trainer

# App Vision:

A web app that allows users to identify songs from a playlist by listening to a
random short snippet of that song.

This will be used to train our team for bar trivia.

# Research Needed:
* Spotify API documentation

# Questions:

* Can this be done with a frontend only app?
* What should the tech stack be? I am familiar with React, and Rails, but am
  open to other options if they make more sense.

# Known Limitations:

I expect that I will only be able to allow this to work for paying members of
spotify. That is acceptable.
